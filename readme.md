# Welcome to Tag Product 2.x

Welcome to the **Tag Product 2.x** repository! ðŸŽ‰

This project is a significant step forward in overhauling the product tagging workflow by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and other advanced models. Our goal is to streamline and enhance the tagging process for products using state-of-the-art AI technologies.

## What's Inside?

### **Models**
- **GPT-4o**: A powerful language model designed to understand and generate human-like text. It's a key component in improving the accuracy and efficiency of product tagging.
For more information on GPT-4o, you can explore [OpenAI's documentation](https://openai.com/research).
- **HPT**: A multimodal model that combines the strengths of different modalities (text, image, etc.) to provide a more comprehensive tagging solution. HPT is designed to handle complex tagging scenarios where multiple types of data are involved. Learn more about HPT by reading the detailed article on [HyperGAI's blog](https://hypergai.com/blog/hpt-1-5-air-best-open-sourced-8b-multimodal-llm-with-llama-3).

These models work together to bring you the next generation of product tagging, making the process more intuitive and robust.
