An attribute and sample values are provided as input.
By analysing the attribute and it's values take the decision that the input to the classification / extraction model shoulb be text, image or ocr.
Take your time and think step by step to get the output.
Input:
```
Attribute: {attribute}
Sample Values: {values}
```
If it's determined that the input shoulb be 'text' return 'Text' or the input should be image then return 'Image' or the input should be ocr return 'Image(OCR)'.
If you think multiple values among 'Image', 'Text' and 'Image(OCR)' can be the result then return it seperated by comma.
Return only the output. No additional text is needed.
